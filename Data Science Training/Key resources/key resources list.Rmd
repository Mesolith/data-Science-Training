```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Starting Point 
These are the key resources that are the first things that I found usefull in transitioning to a more reproducible and repeatable work flow. They are the starting point for this process which began in earnest in July 2020. Some aspects such as RStudio I had alrady been using. Others I was aware of but not really using such as Rmarkdown and git hub. Others aspects were new to me particularly integrating all of the part to make a new work flow. 

At this stage this doucument is a way of keeping a record of the key resources, practising rmarkdown and keeping track of my progess.

in no particular order at the moment

* Rmarkdown pages from the Rstudio web site

That is the list as of 4th july 2020

but this is jus a change to see how git works
